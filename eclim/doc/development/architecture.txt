Architecture
************

The eclim architecture is pretty straight forward.  Commands issued by
a user in vim are relayed via nailgun
(http://www.martiansoftware.com/nailgun/) to the running eclim daemon
and the proper command implementation is then located and executed.

Here is a diagram showing the sequence in a bit more detail:

The commands which are executed on the eclimd side are also fairly
simple. They accept an object containing the command line parameters
passed into the eclim invocation and then return an object (String,
Collection, etc) which is converted to a json response.  Below is a
simple class diagram showing the hierarchy of a couple typical
commands.

Another important aspect of eclim's architecture is support for
plugins. Plugins for eclim are bundled as eclipse plugins with their
auto start attribute set to false.  When the eclim daemon starts it
will locate and load any eclipse plugin with an 'org.eclim.' prefix.

When a plugin is loaded, eclim will locate the plugin's required
resources provider and invoke its initialize method which will then
inject its resources (messages, command options, etc) into eclim and
register any new commands.

Here is graphical representation of this process:
