Building the eclim installer
****************************

Unless you are working on improvements to the eclim installer, you
shouldnâ€™t ever need to build it, but should the need arise here are
the instructions for doing so.

To build the installer you first need a couple external tools
installed:

- sphinx (http://sphinx-doc.org): Sphinx is used to build the eclim
  documentation which is included in the installer.
  Eclim also uses a custom sphinx theme which is included in eclim as
  a git submodule. So before you can build the installer you will need
  to initialize the submodule:

  >
     $ git submodule init
     $ git submodule update

  <

- graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/):  The docs include a few uml
  diagrams which are generated using plantuml
  (http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/) (included in the eclim source
  tree) which in turn requires graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/).
Once you have installed the above dependencies, you can then build the
eclim installer with the following command.

>

   $ ant dist
