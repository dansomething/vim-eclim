Php Validation
**************

When saving a php source file that resides in a project, eclim will
update that source file in Eclipse and will report any validation
errors found.  Any errors will be placed in the current window’s
location list (:help location-list) and the corresponding lines in the
source file will be marked via Vim’s :sign functionality with ‘>>’
markers in the left margin.

Automatic validation of php source files can be disabled via the
g:EclimPhpValidate variable (described below).  If you choose to
disable automatic validation, you can still use the :Validate command
to manually validate the current file.


Configuration
=============

Vim Settings (vim-settings)

*g:EclimPhpValidate*

- g:EclimPhpValidate (Default: 1) - If set to 0, disables source
  code validation.
  Note: When enabled, syntastic
    (https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) is disabled so that
    eclim and syntastic don’t step on each other. If you’d like to use
    syntastic over eclim for validation, then simply disable eclim’s
    validation.If you’d like to disable eclim’s source code validation
    for all languages, eclim provides a global variable for that as
    well:>

       let g:EclimFileTypeValidate = 0

    <


- g:EclimPhpHtmlValidate (Default: 0) - If set to a non 0 value,
  enables validating html markup in the php file. Enabling of html
  validation can also be enabled on a per buffer basis using a buffer
  local setting:
  >
     let b:EclimPhpHtmlValidate = 1

  <

- g:EclimValidateSortResults (Default: ‘occurrence’) - If set to
  ‘severity’, the validation results will be sorted by severity
  (errors > warnings > info > etc.)
