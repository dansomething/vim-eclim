Php Search

*:PhpSearch*


Pattern Search
==============

Pattern searching provides a means to widen a search beyond a single
element.  A pattern search can be executed using the command

:PhpSearch -p <pattern> [-t <type> -s <scope> -i -a <action>]

When there is more than 1 result, those results will be placed into
vim's quickfix list (:help quickfix) so that you can easily navigate
them using vim's quickfix commands.

Vim command completion is supported through out the command with the
exception of the pattern to search for.

   :PhpSearch <Tab>
   :PhpSearch -p MyClass* <Tab>
   :PhpSearch -p MyClass* -t <Tab>
   :PhpSearch -p MyClass* -t class <Tab>
   :PhpSearch -p MyClass* -t class -s <Tab>
   :PhpSearch -p MyClass* -t class -s project

<


- -p <pattern>: The pattern to search for.
  Ex.

  >
     MyClass
     myFunction
     my*

  <

- -t <type> (Default: all): The type of element to search for where
  possible types include
  - class
  - function
  - field
- -s <scope> (Default: all): The scope of the search where possible
  values include
  - all - Search the whole workspace.
  - project - Search the current project, dependent projects, and
    libraries.
- -i: Ignore case when searching.
- -a: The vim command to use to open the result (edit, split,
  vsplit, etc).

Element Search
==============

Element searching allows you to place the cursor over just about any
element in a source file (method call, class name, constant) and
perform a search for that element.  Performing an element search is
the same as performing a pattern search with the exception that you do
not specify the -p option since the element under the cursor will be
searched for instead.

If only one result is found and that result is in the current source
file, the cursor will be moved to the element found. Otherwise, on
single result matches, the value of |g:EclimPhpSearchSingleResult|
will be consulted for the action to take. If there are multiple
results, the quickfix list will be opened with the list of results.

*:PhpSearchContext*

As a convenience eclim also provides the command :PhpSearchContext.
This command accepts only the optional -a argument described above,
and will perform the appropriate search depending on the context of
the element under the cursor.

- If the cursor is on the file name in a require or include call, it
  will search the configured include path for the file.
- Otherwise, it will search for the declaration of the element.

Configuration
=============

Vim Settings (vim-settings)

*g:EclimPhpSearchSingleResult*

- g:EclimPhpSearchSingleResult (Default: 'split') - Determines what
  action to take when a only a single result is found.
  Possible values include:

  - 'split' - open the result in a new window via "split".
  - 'edit' - open the result in the current window.
  - 'tabnew' - open the result in a new tab.
  This setting overrides the global default for all supported language
  types which can be set using the g:EclimDefaultFileOpenAction
  setting which accepts the same possible values.

- g:EclimQuickFixOpen (Default: 'botright copen') Specifies the
  command used to open the quickfix window when multiple results are
  found.
- g:EclimQuickFixHeight (Default: 10) - Sets the height, in lines,
  of the quickfix window when eclim opens it to display search
  results.
