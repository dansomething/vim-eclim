*:PythonSearch*


Element Search
==============

Element searching allows you to place the cursor over just about any
element in a source file (method call, class name, constant) and
perform a search for that element by issuing the command
:PythonSearch. By default this command will search for declarations,
but you can specify that you want to search for references using:

>

   :PythonSearch -x references

<


If only one result is found and that result is in the current source
file, the cursor will be moved to the element found. Otherwise, on
single result matches, the value of |g:EclimPythonSearchSingleResult|
will be consulted for the action to take. If there are multiple
results, the quickfix list will be opened with the list of results.
You can also force the action to use for the current search by
suppling the -a <action> arg:

>

   :PythonSearch -x references -a edit

<


Note: :PythonSearch does not currently support searching for
  patterns. Attempting to supply a pattern to search for will result
  in an error.

*:PythonSearchContext*

As a convenience eclim also provides the command :PythonSearchContext.
This command accepts only the optional -a argument described above,
and will perform the appropriate search depending on the context of
the element under the cursor.

- If the cursor is on the declaration of a class, function, or
  method then it will search for all occurrences.
- Otherwise, it will search for the declaration of the element.

Configuration
=============

Vim Settings (|vim-settings|)

*g:EclimPythonSearchSingleResult*

- g:EclimPythonSearchSingleResult (Default: 'split') - Determines
  what action to take when a only a single result is found.
  Possible values include:

  - 'split' - open the result in a new window via "split".
  - 'edit' - open the result in the current window.
  - 'tabnew' - open the result in a new tab.
  This setting overrides the global default for all supported language
  types which can be set using the g:EclimDefaultFileOpenAction
  setting which accepts the same possible values.

- g:EclimQuickFixOpen (Default: 'botright copen') Specifies the
  command used to open the quickfix window when multiple results are
  found.
- g:EclimQuickFixHeight (Default: 10) - Sets the height, in lines,
  of the quickfix window when eclim opens it to display search
  results.
