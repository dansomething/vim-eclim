Configuration
=============

Eclim Settings (|vim-settings|)

*org.eclim.user.name*

- org.eclim.user.name Should be set to your name. Used by various
  commands that add contact or author information to a file.

*org.eclim.user.email*

- org.eclim.user.email Should be set to the email address where you
  can be contacted.  Used by various commands that add contact or
  author information to a file.

*org.eclim.project.version*

- org.eclim.project.version Should be set to the version number of
  your project.  This is used by various commands that add version
  info to a file or utilize the version number in some other manner.

  Defaults to "1.0".

Vim Settings (|vim-settings|)

The following is a list of some of the common Vim variables available.

*g:EclimLogLevel*

- g:EclimLogLevel (Default: 4)

  Much like the Vim 'verbose' option, this variable allows you to
  control the level of output from eclim as follows:

  - <= 0: No output.

  - >= 1: Fatal errors.

  - >= 2: Errors.

  - >= 3: Warning messages.

  - >= 4: Info messages.

  - >= 5: Debug messages.

  - >= 6: Trace messages.

  Each level also has a corresponding variable to set the highlighting
  group used for the text.

  *g:EclimFatalHighlight*
  - g:EclimFatalHighlight (Default: "Error")

  *g:EclimErrorHighlight*
  - g:EclimErrorHighlight (Default: "Error")

  *g:EclimWarningHighlight*
  - g:EclimWarningHighlight (Default: "WarningMsg")

  *g:EclimInfoHighlight*
  - g:EclimInfoHighlight (Default: "Statement")

  *g:EclimDebugHighlight*
  - g:EclimDebugHighlight (Default: "Normal")

  *g:EclimTraceHighlight*
  - g:EclimTraceHighlight (Default: "Normal")

*g:EclimSignLevel*

- g:EclimSignLevel (Default: 5)

  Behaves just like g:EclimLogLevel except this applies to placing of
  Vim signs for displaying validation errors / warnings, or marking
  :[vim]grep matches.

  The resulting signs also use the same highlighting variables above.

*g:EclimEchoHighlight*

- g:EclimEchoHighlight (Default: "Statement")

  Determines which highlight group will be used for informative
  messages.

*g:EclimBrowser*

- g:EclimBrowser (Default: Dependent on OS)

  Configures the external web browser to use when opening urls. By
  default eclim will attempt to set a default browser based on your
  system, but if it cannot find a compatible browser, you will need to
  set one in your vimrc.

  - Firefox
    let g:EclimBrowser = 'firefox'

  - Mozilla
    let g:EclimBrowser = 'mozilla'

  - Opera
    let g:EclimBrowser = 'opera'

  - IE
    let g:EclimBrowser = 'iexplore'

  Note: The above examples assume that the browser executable is in
  your path. On windows machines they won't be by default, so you will
  need to add them.

*g:EclimShowCurrentError*

- g:EclimShowCurrentError (Default: 1)

  This variable determines whether or not a CursorHold autocommand is
  created that will echo the error associated with the current line if
  any error exists.  Setting this variable to 0 disables this feature.

*g:EclimMakeLCD*

- g:EclimMakeLCD (Default: 1)

  When set to a non-0 value, all eclim based make commands (:Ant,
  :Maven, :Mvn, etc) will change to the current file's project root
  before executing.

  Enabling this has the benefit of allowing you to run these commands
  from any file regardless of where it was opened from without having
  to worry about the directory it is executing from.  For example if
  you have a file open from project A and split a file from project B,
  you can execute :Ant from the project B file and it will utilize
  project B's build.xml even though your current working directory is
  in project A.

*g:EclimMenus*

- g:EclimMenus (Default: 1)

  When set to a non-0 value, enabled auto generation of gvim menus
  (under Plugin.eclim) for each eclim command available for the
  current buffer.
