*vim-validation*

Note: When enabled, syntastic
  (https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) is disabled so that eclim
  and syntastic don't step on each other. If you'd like to use
  syntastic over eclim for validation, then simply disable eclim's
  validation.If you'd like to disable eclim's source code validation
  for all languages, eclim provides a global variable for that as
  well:>

     let g:EclimFileTypeValidate = 0
