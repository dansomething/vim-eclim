Running
=======

Much like the provided ant (|vim-java-ant|) execution functionality,
eclim also provides commands for running maven 1.x or 2.x.

Eclim provides the following commands:

>

   :Maven [<goal> ...]
   :Mvn [<goal> ...]

<


which perform the following steps:

- Save any previous 'makeprg' and 'errorformat' option settings so
  that you can define your own settings for the :make command.

- Set 'makeprg' to execute maven or mvn with the --find option so that
  it will search for your pom file in the current directory or in a
  parent directory.

- Set 'errorformat' to recognize the following errors:

  - javac errors.

  - javadoc errors.

  - junit errors / failures.

- Execute :make.

- Restore your previous 'makeprg' and 'errorformat' option settings.

Additionally, if g:EclimMakeLCD (|vim-core-eclim#g:EclimMakeLCD|) is
enabled (which it is by default), then the execution of maven will be
performed from the current buffer's project root directory, ensuring
that mavens's build file discovery method is performed from the
buffer's working directory and not your own.

Note that :Mvn MUST have this enabled since maven 2.x no longer has
support for the --find option.

Note: Both :Maven and :Mvn also supports use of '!' (:Maven!) just like
  :make does, which tells Vim not to jump to the first error if one
  exists.

Dependency Search
=================

Maven provides online repositories where it will download dependencies
from at build time.  One problem is that finding all your dependencies
and then adding them to your pom file can become labor intensive.  To
help alleviate this, eclim provides commands for searching via the web
service provided by jarvana.com (http://www.jarvana.com/jarvana/).

- :MavenDependencySearch <artifact> - Available when editing a maven
  1.x project.xml file.

- :MvnDependencySearch <artifact> - Available when editing a maven 2.x
  pom.xml file.

These two commands will search for the specified artifact and open a
window containing the results.  You can then add one of the results as
a dependency to your pom file by simply hitting <enter> on it.

Example when calling :MvnDependencySearch junit
