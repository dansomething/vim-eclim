Code Completion
***************

All the code completion functionality provided by eclim (ant, java,
etc) makes use of the new "User Defined Completion" added to Vim 7.
To initiate code completion enter insert mode and type Ctrl-X Ctrl-U.
By default Vim will open a popup if there is more than one completion.

*g:EclimCompletionMethod*

Note: If you would prefer to have eclim use vim's omni code completion
  instead, you can add the following to your vimrc:>

     let g:EclimCompletionMethod = 'omnifunc'

  <


  When using omnifunc you will use Ctrl-X Ctrl-O to start code
  completion.

Once you have started the completion you can use Ctrl-N to proceed to
the next match and Ctrl-P to move to the previous match.

If you are like me and you find those key strokes a bit cumbersome,
then you can use the SuperTab
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643) plugin which
allows you to use the Tab key for completion.

Another option, which can be used in lieu of or with SuperTab, is the
AutoComplPop (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1879)
plugin, which will automatically trigger code completion as you type.

AutoComplPop by default only supports triggering code completion for
file types who have an omni completion that ships with vim, but you
can configure it to support eclim code completion. Here is an example
of some vim script you can add to your vimrc to enabled AutoComlPop
for java file types (this example will trigger the completion popup
when at least 3 characters have been typed after a dot, but you can
tweak this to your tastes):

>

   let g:acp_behaviorJavaEclimLength = 3
   function MeetsForJavaEclim(context)
     return g:acp_behaviorJavaEclimLength >= 0 &&
           \ a:context =~ '\k\.\k\{' . g:acp_behaviorJavaEclimLength . ',}$'
   endfunction
   let g:acp_behavior = {
       \ 'java': [{
         \ 'command': "\<c-x>\<c-u>",
         \ 'completefunc' : 'eclim#java#complete#CodeComplete',
         \ 'meets'        : 'MeetsForJavaEclim',
       \ }]
     \ }
