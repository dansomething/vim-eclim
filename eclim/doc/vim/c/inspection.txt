*:CCallHierarchy*


C/C++ Code Inspection
*********************


Call Hierarchy
==============

When viewing a c or c++ source file you can view the call hierarchy of
a function or method by issuing the command :CCallHierarchy.  This
will open a temporary buffer with an inversed tree view of the
hierarchy of callers of the requested function or method.

>

   fun2(int)
      fun1(int)
        main()
        fun3(int)
      fun3(int)

<


While you are in the hierarchy tree buffer, you can jump to the call
under the cursor using one of the following key bindings:

- <cr> - open the type using the (default action).
- E - open the type via :edit
- S - open the type via :split
- T - open the type via :tabnew
- ? - view help buffer
:CCallHierarchy can also be used to view the callees for a function or
method by invoking the command with a !:

>

   :CCallHierarchy!

<
