Welcome to Eclim
****************

The power of Eclipse in your favorite editor.


What is it?
===========

Eclim provides the ability to access Eclipse (http://eclipse.org) code
editing features (code completion, searching, code validation, and
many more (features)) via the command line or a local network
connection, allowing those features to be integrated with your
favorite editor. Eclim provides an integration with Vim
(http://www.vim.org), but third party clients (relatedprojects) have
been created to add eclim support to other editors as well (emacs,
sublime text 2, textmate).

There are three primary usage scenarios in which eclim is designed to
be used:

1. The first scenario (eclimd#eclimd-headless) is for those for
   which vim is their primary editing interface.  In this scenario you
   run a headless instance of eclipse which all vim instances can then
   communicate with to provide the various eclipse features.
2. The second scenario (eclimd#eclimd-headed) is for those who
   prefer using vim as their main interface, but frequently end up
   jumping back to eclipse for any features not provided by eclim.  In
   this case you can run the eclim server inside of the eclipse gui
   and then interact with it via external vim instances just like the
   first scenario.
3. The last scenario (eclimd#gvim-embedded) is for those who wish
   to use the eclipse interface full time, but want to use gvim as an
   embedded eclipse editor. Just like the previous use case, the eclim
   server is run inside of the eclipse gui and the embedded gvim will
   interact with it just like external vim instances would. This
   feature is only support Linux systems (where gvim is compiled with
   the gtk gui).
   Note: Please be aware that the embedded vim does not behave like
     a standard eclipse editor. It’s a separate program (vim) embedded
     into eclipse, so eclipse features are provided by eclim’s vim
     plugins and not the usual eclipse key bindings, context menus,
     etc. For those that just want vim like key bindings in their
     eclipse editors, vrapper (http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/home/)
     is an excellent alternative which provides exactly that.
