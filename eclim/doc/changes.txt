******************

*2.3.2* *1.7.18*


2.3.2 / 1.7.18 (Sep. 12, 2013)
==============================

Installer:
   - Fixed extraction of scala vim files when installing scala
     support.

Php:
   - Fixed completion of php namespaces.

*2.3.1*


2.3.1 (Jul. 27, 2013)
=====================

Installer:
   - Fixed dependencies to point at the Kepler update site.

Git Log (2.3.1) (https://github.com/ervandew/eclim/compare/2.3.0...2.3.1)

*2.3.0* *1.7.17*


2.3.0 / 1.7.17 (Jul. 21, 2013)
==============================

Java:
   - :NewJarEntry (|:NewJarEntry_java|) now accepts up to 3 arguments
     allowing you to create the jar entry with the path to the jar,
     path to the source, and the path to the javadocs.

   - On javadoc search, all results, including results found in jar
     files, will be fully translated to usable urls to be opened by
     vim instead of sending jar results back to eclipse to let it open
     them. With this change your chosen brower on the vim side will
     always be used.

   - Fix for import grouping by package on Kepler.

Php:
   Warning: Reminder: The format of the h2 database used for php searching
     and code completion has changed in Kepler which may result in
     searching / code completion not returning any results, both in
     eclim and in the standard eclipse php editor.  To fix this you'll
     need to stop eclipse, remove the old index, and then restart:>

        $ rm -r <your workspace>/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.dltk.core.index.sql.h2/

     <


Scala:
   - Updated to require 3.0.1 of the Scala IDE which now supports
     Kepler (for eclim 2.3.0 only). Since this version of the Scala
     IDE seems to only support Scala 2.10.x now, the option to install
     2.9.x version has been removed, however the indigo release of
     eclim (1.7.17) still supports the Scala 2.9.x version of Scala
     IDE 3.0.0.

Xml:
   - |:XmlFormat| now uses the DOM3 APIs to improve the formatted
     result, honoring your textwidth and indent settings.

*2.2.7* *1.7.16*


2.2.7 / 1.7.16 (Jul. 14, 2013)
==============================

Java:
   - Fix for some completions on Kepler.

   - Fix for rare case where an invalid classpath entry could result
     in the .classpath file reverted to the eclipse default.

   - |:JavaCallHierarchy| added to show the caller or callee hierarchy
     of a method. Thanks to Alexandre Fonseca.

Php:
   Warning: The format of the h2 database used for php searching and code
     completion has changed in Kepler which may result in searching /
     code completion not returning any results, both in eclim and in
     the standard eclipse php editor. To fix this you'll need to stop
     eclipse, remove the old index, and then restart:>

        $ rm -r <your workspace>/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.dltk.core.index.sql.h2/

     <


Ruby:
   - Fixed the inserted completion text for some ruby libraries.

Scala:
   - The graphical installer now includes a compiled eclim sdt bundle
     for both scala 2.9.x and 2.10.x for which one will be chosen for
     you if you already have the scala-ide installed, otherwise you
     can pick one and the appropriate version of the scala-ide will be
     installed for you.

Vimplugin:
   - The option to force focusing of gvim with a simulated click is
     now disabled by default, but when enabled, it should be less
     likely to have unintended side affects.

Cygwin:
   - Performance optimization for user's with many projects.

Installer:
   - The installer will now properly shutdown eclimd instances
     registered using the old non-json format.

Docs:
   - Expanded the developer docs (|development-index|) to include docs
     on creating new commands (|development-commands|) along with some
     of the basics for adding new eclim plugins
     (|development-plugins|).

*2.2.6* *1.7.14*


2.2.6 / 1.7.14 (May 18, 2013)
=============================

Bug Fixes:
   - Fixed eclimd to prevent incorrect addition of -d32 on 64bit
     systems, which prevents eclimd from starting.

   - Fix potential conflicts between syntastic validation vs eclim
     validation (syntastic validation will be diabled if eclim
     validation is available for the current file type).

   - Many more fixes.

Android:
   - Updated for ADT 22.0.0

C/C++:
   - |:CCallHierarchy| now support showing callee tree.

Java:
   - |:JavaImpl| now supports anonymous inner classes and will also
     properly handle suggesting methods from a nested superclass.

Php:
   - Eclim will no longer run php files through html validation by
     default (see the Php Validation (|vim-php-validate|) doc for
     settings to enable html validation).

Scala:
   - Scala support updated for Scala IDE 3.0.0.

   - Scala now supported on both versions of eclim (Juno and Indigo).

2.2.5 / 1.7.13 (Nov. 25, 2012)
==============================

Eclim:
   - 1.7.13 and above will now support Eclipse 3.8 as well as 3.7.

   - Fix |:ProjectGrep| and |:ProjectTodo| to search in all of the
     project's links as well.

*2.2.4* *1.7.12*


2.2.4 / 1.7.12 (Nov. 18, 2012)
==============================

Eclim:
   - Updated |:ProjectTree| and |:ProjectTab| to support an arbitrary
     directory as an argument, allowing you to use the command for
     project's not managed by eclipse/eclim. :TreeTab has been removed
     since the update to :ProjectTab makes it redundant.

   - Creation of projects in nested directories in the eclipse
     workspace (vs at the root of the workspace) is now properly
     supported through eclim.

Android:
   - Updated for ADT 21.0.0.

     the external nailgun client (vs the python client).

*2.2.2* *1.7.10*


2.2.2 / 1.7.10 (Oct. 07, 2012)
==============================

Eclimd:
   - Updated eclimd script for Linux/OSX to supply reasonable defaults
     for heap and perm gen space if not already set by ~/.eclimrc.

C/C++:
   - Fixed C++ project creation to auto add the required C nature.

   - Fixed C/C++ issues introduced by the eclipse 4.2.1 release
     (project create/refresh and call hierarchy).

Java:
   - :JavaImportSort, :JavaImportClean, and :JavaImportMissing all
     removed in favor of a new command which performs the
     functionality of all three: |:JavaImportOrganize|

   - The vim option g:EclimJavaImportExclude has been replaced with
     the eclim setting org.eclim.java.import.exclude
     (|org-eclim-java-import-exclude|).

   - The vim option g:EclimJavaImportPackageSeparationLevel has been
     replaced with the eclim setting
     org.eclim.java.import.package_separation_level
     (|org-eclim-java-import-package-separation-level|).

   - g:EclimJavaBeanInsertIndexed vim variable removed in favor of
     suffixing :JavaGetSet methods with '!'.

   - :JavaCorrect, :JavaImpl, :JavaDelegate, :JavaConstructor, and
     :JUnitImpl all now perform their code manipulations using eclipse
     operations.

   - Initial support added for running :JavaSearch commands from
     source file results (library source files) not in a project.

   - g:EclimJavaCheckstyleOnSave replaced with the eclim setting
     org.eclim.java.checkstyle.onvalidate
     (|org-eclim-java-checkstyle-onvalidate|).

   - g:EclimJavaSrcValidate renamed to g:EclimJavaValidate.

   - :JUnitExecute replaced with a new and improved |:JUnit| command.

   - Added the command |:JUnitFindTest| to open the corresponding test
     for the current file.

   - Removed :Javac command since eclipse's continuous incremental
     builds typically make the :Javac call a no op, and in cases where
     you need to induce compilation, |:ProjectBuild| does so in a
     language agnostic way.

   - Added |:JavaMove| command to move a java source file from one
     package to another.

   - Added |:JavaDocPreview| to display the javadoc of the element
     under the cursor in vim's preview window.

C/C++:
   - Semantic errors are now included in the validation results.

   - Added folding support to C/C++ call hierarchy buffer.

   - |:ProjectRefresh| now waits on the C/C++ indexer to finish before

     tab, using "Save As" from eclipse, and jumping to a line number
     from the project tree etc.)
